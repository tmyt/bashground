Bash on Windows processes keep in backgroud.

motivation
----

One day, I start tmux session in Bash on Windows and Close terminal. "I loved tmux :)"

After a few minutes, I open new terminal and type command `tmux a` but tmux does not seen. Because Bash on Windows subsystem shutted down when all terminal closed.

This program keeps Bash on Windows Subsystem in background!
